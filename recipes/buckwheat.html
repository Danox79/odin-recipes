    <h2>Description</h2>
    <p>Buckwheat is a healthy, gluten-free seed with a nutty, toasty flavor and soft texture. It is not as popular as oats and wheat and often under-appreciated, but it’s so easy to prepare and inexpensive.</p>
    <p>Its name “buckwheat” is a little confusing and included in the list of grains, but it is not related to wheat and it is not a grain. It’s just as simple to prepare as White Rice. Learn How to Cook Buckwheat Kasha perfectly every time!</p>
    <h2>Ingredients</h2>
    <ul>
        <li>Buckwheat</li>
        <li>Water</li>
        <li>Salt</li>
        <li>Butter</li>
    </ul>
    <h2>Steps</h2>
    <ol>
        <li>Place 1 cup toasted buckwheat groats into a fine-mesh strainer and rinse under cool running water until the water runs clear. Drain it well.</li>
        <li>In a small saucepan (covered with lid), bring 1 1/2 cups cold water, 2 tablespoons unsalted butter and 1/2 teaspoon fine salt to a boil over high heat.</li>
        <li>Stir in the buckwheat into boiled water and cover saucepan with lid. Bring back to a gentle simmer and reduce the heat to low. Cook until the water is absorbed, 13-15 minutes. (Just like rice, you should hear hissing while it’s cooking and it will get quiet once done). Nonstick saucepans will take 2-3 minutes longer to cook buckwheat.</li>
        <li>Remove from heat and let the buckwheat rest covered for 10 minutes. Fluff with a fork and serve. This serving will make about 3 cups of cooked buckwheat. Add more butter if desired, but avoid stirring too much to prevent from mushing cooked buckwheat.</li>
        <li>Enjoy fresh or refrigerate once cooled. Avoid leaving at room temperature for prolonged hours.</li>
    </ol>
