    <h2>Description</h2>
    <p>Hard boiled eggs are great food to have on hand as their uses are so versatile. Not only are they super delicious on their own, but theyâ€™re great in sandwiches, chopped up on salads and the foundation for all devilled eggs.
     </p>
     <p>The trick to great hard boiled eggs is not over-cooking them, which can leave a grey ring around the yolk and make their texture a bit rubbery. Download our free Egg Timer app to ensure your eggs turn out perfectly every time!

     <h2>Ingredients</h2>
     <ul>
        <li>Eggs</li>
        <li>Pot with lid</li>
        <li>Water</li>
     </ul>
     <h2>Steps</h2>
     <ol>
        <li>Place your eggs in a single layer on the bottom of your pot and cover with cold water. The water should be about an inch or so higher than the eggs. Cover the pot with a lid.</li>
        <li>Over high heat, bring your eggs to a rolling boil.</li>
        <li>Remove from heat and let stand in water for 10-12 minutes for large eggs. Reduce the time slightly for smaller eggs, and increase the standing time for extra-large eggs.</li>
        <li>Drain water and immediately run cold water over eggs until cooled. Rapid cooling helps prevent a green ring from forming around the yolks.</li>
     </ol>
