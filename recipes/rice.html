    <h2>Description</h2>
    <p>Just can't master the art of cooking rice on the stovetop? No stress—you're not alone. Many things can go wrong when prepping rice: too gummy, too hard, burnt. But, once you've got it down, it's simple to get it right every time.</p>
    <p>Before you know it, you'll have a steaming bowl of rice ready to be made into our easy Buddha bowls or topped with beef and broccoli for the easiest weeknight dinner. </p>
    <h2>Ingredients</h2>
    <ul>
        <li>Rice</li>
        <li>Water</li>
        <li>Pot with lid</li>
    </ul>   
    <h2>Steps</h2>
    <ol>
        <li>Ugh, I know, rinsing is annoying, but it really is worth it to get rid of the dusty starches that may make the rice too sticky. Just place your rice in a fine mesh strainer and rinse under cold water until the water runs clear.</li>
        <li>For most types of rice, you'll always use a ratio of 1 cup rice to 2 cups water, which you can scale up or down. (Double-check your rice packaging to be sure.) Feel free to swap in chicken or vegetable broth for more flavor.</li>
        <li>Then, stir in your rice and salt. And if you want to add a tab of butter, too, go for it — your rice will taste 10x better.</li>
        <li>After adding the rice, the temperature of your water will drop significantly, and it'll stop boiling. Let it come back to a gentle simmer (otherwise you run the risk of your water cooking off faster than your rice gets tender).</li>
        <li>Cover the saucepan and reduce heat to low. Though it will be tempting, keep the lid on! It's very important not to mess with the steam. </li>
        <li>For long grain white rice, I always set a timer for 18, knowing that it could need another minute or two. Let the rice be your indicator, not the water. If there's a little water leftover, it's totally fine! Just tilt the saucepan slightly to drain it out. (Cooking brown rice? Check at 30 minutes.)</li>
        <li>Turn off the heat, replace the lid, and let it rest for a few minutes in the steamy saucepan. Patience is a virtue, my friend. </li>
        <li>Use a fork to gently mix and lift rice to make sure that the grains don't stick together.</li>
    </ol>
